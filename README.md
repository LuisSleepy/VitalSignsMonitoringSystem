# VitalSignsMonitoringSystem
Utilization of NodeMCU-32S ESP32 development board in designing a vital sign monitoring system using BLE and Wi-Fi

This system was developed in line with my undergraduate thesis entitled "Development of a Home Healthcare System for a Person Under Monitoring with Remote Access through Web Application".

This source code was adapted from the works listed below. Modifications were done to be able to develop the vital sign monitoring system of our thesis.
